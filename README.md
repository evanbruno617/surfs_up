* One Key difference regarding the temperatures in June and December is that December has a slightly lower average temperature of 71 wheras in June the average is 75
* The standard deviation in December is slightly higher with 3.7 where in June it is 3.2. This means that there is a bigger range in temperature with its 25th and 75th percentile having a 15 degree difference where June has only a 4 degree difference. This means that temperature is more consistent in June and varies more in December.
* The minimum temperature in June is also a lot higher with it being 64 degrees where in December it can reach as low as 56 degrees. \

## Results 
With the given results It is easy to conclude that June has far more consistent and hotter temperatures than December. However the mean of the temperatures vary very little with December having nearly the same mean temperature as June. Before determining if the shop would be sustainable year-round I should create one query for June and another for December to compare the precipitation data to determine if the shop would be profitable year-round.
